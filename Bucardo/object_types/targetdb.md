title: Bucardo targetdb
---

The **targetdb** is used as one possible destination for a [sync](/Bucardo/objecy_types/sync). It points to an entry in the [db table](/Bucardo/schema/db) and refers to a single database. If more than one target database is needed, you must use a [targetgroup](/Bucardo/object_types/targetgroup) instead.
