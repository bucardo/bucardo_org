title: Bucardo targetdb
---

The **targetdb** is used as one possible destination for a [sync](/Bucardo/objecy_types/sync).
It points to an entry in the [db table](/Bucardo/schema/db) and refers
ato a single (slave) database.  If more than one slave database is needed,
you must use a [targetgroup](/Bucardo/object_types/targetgroup) instead.
