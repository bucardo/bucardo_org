Postgres **sequences** can be replicated.

Pushdelta syncs and sequences
-----------------------------

In most cases, you will not need to replicate sequences, unless your slaves
are not read-only, or if you want your slaves to be ready
for [failover](/Bucardo/operations/failover).  If you do decide to replicate
them, just treat them like you would a table: add them to the [goat table](/Bucardo/schema/goat),
gather them into [relgroups](/Bucardo/object_types/relgroup), and associate them
with one or more [syncs](/Bucardo/object_types/sync).

Swap syncs and sequences
------------------------

If you are using a [swap sync](/Bucardo/object_types/swap),
the best practice is to *not* replicate sequences,
but to make sure that they are different on both sides,
such that an insert on database A will never conflict with an insert
on database B.  There are three general ways to do this:

1.  Use interleaving sequences. On database A, define the sequence as START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 2. On database B, define the sequence as START WITH 2 INCREMENT BY 2. Thus, the two sequences will never have the same value.
2.  Use different ranges. For example, database A would use a sequence of START WITH 1, while database B uses START WITH 100000000. This is not foolproof, as A can eventually catch up with B, although you can define A as MAXVALUE 99999999.
3.  Use a common sequence. This relies on one or both of the databases using a function that makes a call to an external sequence.
