title: Bucardo bucardorc
---

Options for [bucardo](/Bucardo/bucardo) can be specified either at the command line or inside configuration files. There are three files that are checked in order, and the first one that is found is used:

-   .bucardorc in the current directory
-   .bucardorc in the user's home directory
-   /etc/bucardorc

The format of each file is simply **name=value**, where name is any of the options passed to the bucardo program. Any command line options will override the options in the bucardorc file.

If the option **--no-bucardorc** is given to bucardo, none of the bucardorc files will be used.

You can also specify the location of a bucardorc file to use, by using **--bucardorc=filename**. If this option is used, all other default locations above will be ignored, and the program will error out if the file is not found.
