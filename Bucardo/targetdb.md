title: Bucardo targetdb
---

The **targetdb** is used as one possible destination for a [sync](/Bucardo/sync). It points to an entry in the [bucardo.db](/Bucardo/schema/bucardo.db) table and referes to a single (slave) database. If more than one slave database is needed, you must use a [targetgroup](/Bucardo/targetgroup) instead.
