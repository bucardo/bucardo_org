This repository contains the source MarkDown documents for the Bucardo.org site,
including all Bucardo documentation.

This project is intended to be built via Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/)

The short version for getting this running locally:

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle
    $ # install nodejs or other JS runtime
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

This will create a static version of this site in the `_site` directory and
start a server from localhost that you can browse and test any changes.

This toolchain requires some form of runtime JS support; see this list here:

    https://github.com/rails/execjs

Submit a pull request with any documentation improvements, etc, and if approved
we will update the main bucardo.org site to match.
