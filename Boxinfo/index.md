title: Boxinfo
---

**boxinfo** is a Perl script for quickly gathering all sorts of interesting information about a particular computer, which is then put into a HTML or MediaWiki page. It is very handy for being able to see a quick overview of the boxes that you are responsible for. The script has a highly developed [Postgres](/Postgres) section. It was developed at End Point Corporation by Greg Sabino Mullane.

### Download

The latest version, 1.4.0, can be downloaded here:

-   [boxinfo.pl](http://bucardo.org/downloads/boxinfo.pl)
-   [boxinfo.pl.asc](http://bucardo.org/downloads/boxinfo.pl.asc)

### Basic Usage

Usage is simply to run:

` perl boxinfo.pl`

It is preferred that the script gets run as the 'root' user, as some of the information can only be gathered by that user. Two files are created by the script:

#### boxinfo.html

This is the final result, either in HTML or MediaWiki format (see the --format argument below). A [sample output page](/Boxinfo/Example) is available.

#### boxinfo.debug

This is a copy of each command that was run, and the result. Feel free to delete it, it is only useful for debugging.

    -   Returns the version number.
-   --verbose
